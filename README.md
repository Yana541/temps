# Average July Temperatures by City

This program calculates and displays the average July temperatures for ten cities. The cities and their respective temperatures are stored in a data structure called `avg_temp`, which contains the name of the city and its temperature. The program then sorts the cities based on their temperatures in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.
This function implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort the cities based on their temperatures in ascending order. It iterates through the `temps` array and compares adjacent temperatures. If the temperature of the current city is greater than the temperature of the next city, it swaps their positions. This process continues until all cities are sorted in ascending order of temperature.
